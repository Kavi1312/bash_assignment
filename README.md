1. Create a Directory Structure:
Write a script that creates the following directory structure:
   /home/user/
       ├── projects/
       │   ├── project1/
       │   ├── project2/
       │   └── project3/
       ├── documents/
       └── downloads/

folders Created:
projects/:
Contains three subdirectories: project1/, project2/, and project3/.
documents/:
General directory for storing user documents.
downloads/:
General directory for storing downloaded files.
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have:
Bash installed (which is standard on most Linux systems).
Correct permissions to create directories in the target location (typically, the /home/user/ directory).
Script Usage:-Clone or download the script to your local machine.
Run the script using the following command:
bash
Copy code
bash create_directories.sh
Explanation:
The script dynamically uses the current user’s home directory (i.e., /home/$USER).
It creates the projects, documents, and downloads directories.
Inside the projects folder, three subfolders are created: project1, project2, and project3.
The mkdir -p command is used to create parent directories if they don't exist.
Customizing the Script
If you want to customize the directory names or paths:
Modify the base_dir variable to set a different base directory.
Example: base_dir="/path/to/custom/directory"
You can add more project folders or modify existing ones by changing the mkdir -p commands.
Troubleshooting
Permission Denied: Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to create directories in /home/user/.
Directory already exists: The mkdir -p command won't report an error if the directories already exist.
